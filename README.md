# README Generator - V1

## Description
This project is designed to analyze a codebase by reading all files within a specified directory, excluding certain file types, and generating a comprehensive `README.md` file for GitHub repositories. The generated README includes detailed information about the project's title, description, features, installation instructions, usage examples, project structure, dependencies, and more.

## Features
- **File Reading**: Reads all files in a given directory while skipping specific file types.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully when reading files with `utf-8` encoding and ignores non-text files.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses an AI agent to generate the README based on the project's content.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have a valid API key for the LLM service (e.g., Ollama) configured.

## Usage
1. Run the main script to generate the README:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The generated `README.md` file will be saved in the project directory.


## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

```
project/
├── main.py
