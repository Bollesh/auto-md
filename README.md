# Auto MD Project - v3

This project is designed to automate the generation of a README.md file by analyzing the project codebase and extracting relevant information such as dependencies, structure, features, and usage instructions.

## Description

The `Auto MD` project uses advanced techniques like text splitting, embedding, and vector database creation to generate a comprehensive README.md. It processes all files in a specified directory, extracts their content, splits it into manageable chunks, and stores them in a searchable format for easy retrieval and documentation generation.

## Features

- **Automated Codebase Analysis**: Analyzes the project structure, dependencies, and key features.
- **Text Splitting and Embedding**: Processes large text files into smaller, more manageable pieces using recursive character splitting and embedding techniques.
- **Vector Database Creation**: Creates a searchable vector database to facilitate quick retrieval of relevant information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bollesh/auto-md.git
   cd auto-md/
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for necessary configurations.

## Usage

1. **Files Location**
    Before executing the main program, set up your project's files in the "project/" directory. If no such directory is there, create it in the root directory

2. **Run Application**:
   Execute the main application to start processing files and generating the README.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Customize Configuration**:
   Modify the configuration settings in `vector_db.py` as needed, such as setting up the source path, persistent directory, and model embeddings.

## Project Structure

```
auto_md/
├── vector_db
|   └── vector_db.py
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt

```

- `vector_db.py`: Contains the core logic for text processing, embedding, and database creation.
-  `main.py`: Contains the model which uses the vector database to generate a readme file
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages.

## Dependencies

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
